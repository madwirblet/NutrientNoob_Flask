This folder will contain database(s). Since GitHub will not allow me to upload such a large database, run the 
"recipe_database.py" function to properly set up the "recipes.db" file locally.

Additionally, the "RAW_recipes.csv" file must be added to the project in the NutrientNoob folder in order to work properly.

Link for the "RAW_recipes.csv" file: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions?select=RAW_recipes.csv

NOTE: We only need the "RAW_recipes.csv" file for now. I don't recommend opening it because its pretty big and can slow down 
your computer. This website also contains the order in which the data is presented.



***NEW*** I uploaded the code to configure the nutrition database for our project. Similar to the recipes dataset, you'll have to
download the .csv file and add it to the project directory in the NutrientNoob folder.

Link for the csv file: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutisaxena/food-nutrition-dataset?resource=download
IMPORTANT: Please download only "food.csv" and rename to "RAW_nutrition.csv" when putting it in the project folder
Information about the included nutrition facts is on the website.
