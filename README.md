Welcome to Nutrient Noob-- A website revolutionizing health and nutrition.

Created by: Katheryn A., Tristan P., Sebastian T., and Maddy W.

This is a final project for CEN3031 in which we were tasked to create a website or application that solves an issue in health/ healthcare. The issue we decided to tackle is nutrition, and specifically nutrition education of college students/ young adults. 

Here is some general navigation information for the project:
  - Each page on the site has a .html file
  - There is one styling sheet used for the entire site (elements are broken down by class and then id if needed)
  - All images used on the site are found in the images folder
